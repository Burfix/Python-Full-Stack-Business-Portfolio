## Why This Matters

The GitHub About section is literally the **first thing** hiring managers see:
- It appears on the right sidebar of your repo
- It's in search results
- It signals professionalism (or lack thereof)

Currently it says: "No description, website, or topics provided"  
That's a **credibility killer**.

With these changes it will say:
- ✅ Clear description of what the repo is
- ✅ 8 relevant topics showing expertise
- ✅ Professional signal
